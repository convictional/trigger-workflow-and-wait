# Trigger Workflow and Wait

Github Action for trigger a workflow from another workflow. The action then waits for a response.

**When would you use it?**

When deploying an app you may need to deploy additional services, this Github Action helps with that.

## Example

### Simple

```yaml
- uses: convictional/trigger-workflow-and-wait@v1.6.1
  with:
    owner: keithconvictional
    repo: myrepo
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```

### All Options

```yaml
- uses: convictional/trigger-workflow-and-wait@v1.6.1
  with:
    owner: keithconvictional
    repo: myrepo
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
    github_user: github-user
    workflow_file_name: main.yml
    ref: release-branch
    wait_interval: 10
    client_payload: '{}'
    propagate_failure: false
    trigger_workflow: true
    wait_workflow: true
```

### Comment the current running workflow URL for a PR

```yaml
- uses: convictional/trigger-workflow-and-wait@v1.6.1
  with:
    owner: keithconvictional
    repo: myrepo
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
    comment_downstream_url: ${{ github.event.pull_request.comments_url }}
```

## Testing

You can test out the action locally by cloning the repository to your computer. You can run:

```shell
INPUT_OWNER="keithconvictional" \
INPUT_REPO="myrepo" \
INPUT_GITHUB_TOKEN="<REDACTED>" \
INPUT_GITHUB_USER="github-user" \
INPUT_WORKFLOW_FILE_NAME="main.yml" \
INPUT_REF="release-branch" \
INPUT_WAIT_INTERVAL=10 \
INPUT_CLIENT_PAYLOAD='{}' \
INPUT_PROPAGATE_FAILURE=false \
INPUT_TRIGGER_WORKFLOW=true \
INPUT_WAIT_WORKFLOW=true \
busybox sh entrypoint.sh
```

You will have to create a Github Personal access token. You can create a test workflow to be executed. In a repository, add a new `main.yml` to `.github/workflows/`. The workflow will be:

```shell
name: Main
on:
  workflow_dispatch
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Pause for 25 seconds
        run: |
          sleep 25
```

You can see the example [here](https://github.com/keithconvictional/trigger-workflow-and-wait-example-repo1/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml). For testing a failure case, just add this line after the sleep:

```yaml
...
- name: Pause for 25 seconds
  run: |
    sleep 25
    echo "For testing failure"
    exit 1
```

## Potential Issues

### Changes

If you do not want the latest build all of the time, please use a versioned copy of the Github Action. You specify the version after the `@` sign.

```yaml
- uses: convictional/trigger-workflow-and-wait@v1.6.1
  with:
    owner: keithconvictional
    repo: myrepo
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```
